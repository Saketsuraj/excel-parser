Typescript application to convert excel data to informative json data.

Steps to run the project:

Git clone the repo.                             
Switch to node version v18.18.0 as it was developed on this version.                                           
Run the command "npm install"                                                                                             
Run the command "npm start"                                                                                        
output will come as output.jsonl file (I have attached the file for your reference, you can delete this file and re-run)
